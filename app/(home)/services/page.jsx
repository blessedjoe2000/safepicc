            <p>
              A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is a long, thin
              tube inserted into a peripheral vein, usually in the arm, and
              threaded into a more prominent vein near the heart. This catheter
              is designed for long-term intravenous (IV) access, making it
              suitable for patients requiring extended therapy.

            <p className="my-2">
              <span>Extended Treatment Duration: </span>
              PICC lines are ideal for patients who need long-term IV therapy
              (weeks to months), such as chemotherapy, antibiotics, or total
              parenteral nutrition.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>Minimized Discomfort: </span>
                They provide a more comfortable experience, as they are less
                likely to irritate veins and avoid the discomfort associated
                with frequent needle sticks.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Reduced Risk of Complications: </span>
                Inserted under sterile conditions by trained professionals, PICC
                lines minimize the risk of infections and complications related
                to repeated peripheral access.

              Midline Catheter
            </h2>
            <p>
              A Midline catheter is an IV catheter inserted into a peripheral
              vein, but it is positioned slightly further than a traditional
              peripheral IV, usually terminating in the upper arm. Midlines are
              typically used for shorter-term therapies compared to PICC lines.

              Why Use a Midline Catheter?
            </h2>
            <p className="my-2">
              <span>Shortâ€”to Medium-Term IV Access: </span>
              Midline catheters are excellent for patients requiring IV therapy
              lasting from a few days to several weeks. They are suitable for
              treatments such as hydration, antibiotic therapy, or medication
              administration.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>Less Invasive than PICC Lines: </span>
                Midlines offer a less invasive option for patients who do not
                require the longer-term access provided by PICC lines, reducing
                the likelihood of complications.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Improved Patient Comfort: </span>
                Like PICC lines, Midlines provide a comfortable insertion site,
                minimizing irritation and discomfort from frequent venous
                access.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Easier Maintenance: </span>
                Midline catheters can often be managed with fewer restrictions
                than central lines, allowing for a more flexible treatment
                approach.
